# Writing An Interpreter In Go

This project is my implementation of the Monkey programming language, built by following Thorsten Ball’s book Writing an Interpreter in Go.

It includes a lexer, parser, abstract syntax tree, and evaluator — forming a fully working interpreter written in Go.

Features

Integer and boolean expressions

Variables and environments

Functions and closures

Conditionals and return statements

REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop)
